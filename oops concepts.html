//OOPS CONCEPT 

encapsulation // in simple words, encapsulation is defined as the process of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit. 

 class  Person {
    private String name;

    public String getName(){
        return name ;
    }

    public void setName(String newname){
        name = newname;
    }
 }

 inhertance  // in simple words, inheritance is defined as the process by which one class (subclass or child class) can inherit the properties and methods of another class (superclass or parent class).

 class Animal {
    void eat(){
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }

class Dog Extends Animal {
    void bark(){
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }}
 }


 polymorphism 


 methord overloading compile time polymorphism // methord overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but different parameters (type, number, or both).
 // in simple words, method overloading is  defined as the ability to create multiple methods with the same name in a class, but with different parameter lists.

 class Math {
    int add( int a , int b){
        return a + b;
    }

    int add(int a , int b , int c ){
        return a+b+c;
    }
 }


 methord overridng run time polymorphism // methord overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
 // in simple words, method overriding is defined as the ability of a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }

    void Dog extends Animal {
        void sound() {
            System.out.println("Dog barks");
        }
    }
}


Abstraction 

// abstraction is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows you to hide the complex implementation details and show only the essential features of an object.

// in simpple words, abstraction is defined as the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.

abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw(); // abstract method
}
class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() { // implementation of the abstract method
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}
